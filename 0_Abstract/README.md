# WIPER CONTROL SYSTEM #

A windscreen wiper, sometimes known as a windshield wiper or wiper blade in American English, is a device that cleans the front window of a car, rain, snow, laundry, water, and / or debris. Almost every vehicle, including cars, trucks, buses, trains, and cupboards — and other aircraft — have one or more of these wipers, usually required by law. The wiper is made of metal arm pivoting one end and the other has a long rubber blade attached. The engine, usually an electric motor, drives the arm, but wind power is also used in other vehicles. The blade is flipped back and forth across the glass, removing any water, rain, or other obstructions for viewing. Speed ​​is often modified in cars built after 1969, with varying speeds and often one or more distorted setting. Most commercial vehicles use one or more pantograph arms, while most private vehicles use synchronized radial arms.

Front screen washing system is also used in some vehicles to improve and extend the drying function in dry or frozen conditions. Many well-placed hoses are sprayed with water or window cleaner to prevent frostbite on the front screen in this way. Used in conjunction with wiper blades, these machines help to remove dirt and dust from the windscreen. In this project I explain how the wiper works on stm32, ARM based Microcontroller33
